*** Development

**** Translation
***** TODO average last 10 checkpoints -> use sacrebleu script from fairseq to compute detokenized bleu -> if still not good, can run again for another round
***** TODO re-export and upload new model if performance improves -> update readme and relevant sections
***** strong model being WMT19 single and ensemble with back translation (which adds robustness), while weak model being transformer trained on WMT16 without back translation -> compare general performances and metrics
***** consider also looking into extra references repo "evaluation-of-nmt-bt"
***** possibly keep backups of models at various development stages
***** **extra:** train additional large model on wmt19 non-backtranslated data and similar transformer arch as fair paper -> to get slightly better performance for comparison -> this can also be done later 

**** Clean-code and documentation
***** create modular scripts with instructions in readme: 
****** TODO train translation model 
****** TODO visualize fine-tuned LM result
****** TODO visualize correlation of LM and shallow metrics
****** TODO visualize model training evolutions
****** DONE visualize shallow metrics
****** DONE evaluate using fine-tuned language model
****** DONE fine tune paraphrase detector
****** translate sentences
****** DONE evaluate bleu & chrf
***** TODO update training readme on any new steps/documentation such as checkpoint averaging and add respective scripts where/when necessary
***** TODO add slurm tags in readme for averaging script
***** TODO change translation default checkpoint in shell, python and readme if deemed better
***** TODO add information on how long training took and what DL settings/hardware were used
***** segment readme into training, translation and others categories with relevant usages
***** replace relevant bash commands with sbatch in slurm-s3it branch after repository is completed
***** update initial page of readme with overview/abstract of work including shallow metrics
***** update TOC's in all readmes to reflect latest changes
***** add citations in readme as per general standard
***** add final paper/presentation into repo with link in readme 

**** Visualization
***** TODO think of plotting schemes that could be used on various results of analysis such as paraphrase detection results from all three models -> get creative with these ideas -> can already do this before newer translation model is present
***** TODO add various sub-routines with different visualization shell scripts corresponding to different arguments of python script -> such as defining model paths to plot model evolutions, etc. -> make this more dynamic and practical where possible
***** TODO re-run visualizations with improved NMT model, but prepare pipelines based on current one
***** use memory efficient pipelines and newer visualization techniques to assist in understanding
***** think of effective ways of converting tensorflow event logs to csv's for nicer plotting -> look into event log combination workflow
***** update R dependencies in readme once all visualizations are finalized

**** Evaluation
***** TODO perhaps reliably use paraphrase detection only in cases where initial German paraphrase is positively detected, to ensure some consistency for evaluation
***** TODO check for possibly interesting correlations between XLM-R prediction and chrF/BLEU scores -> this could be of interest in making additional statements to Michel et al. 2019's statements regarding chrF scores
***** consider changing bleu to sacrebleu in json (read more about differences) and figure out why stating this might be important
***** compute statistical tests for ascertaining significance of relationships
***** in rare cases, can do manual analysis and include this inside report
***** report evaluation of fine-tuning paraphrase detector and weaker translation model
***** early conclusions/hypotheses: hand-crafted adversarial paraphrase robustness is handled well in SOTA models due to backtranslation reguralization, main vulnerability will be targetted adversarial samples

**** Paraphrase detection
***** make formal analysis on lengths of WMT19 inputs vs. lengths of paws-x training data
***** consider roc and other evaluation metrics for pawsx model -> in case these might be of more help
***** fine-tune models with English and ensure no or little machine translated data is present in training set
***** better to work with human-curated data than back-translated ones due to many errors -> advantage in PAWS and PAWS-X English data + WMT19 AR paraphrases
***** **extra:** fix and refine paws-x pipeline later on with patience, typing, better documentation, clean-code and possibly continuation of training, add roc auc on pawsx test data

**** Paper
***** use two-column format for final paper, to prepare for paper writing
***** think more about whether to include or exclude adversarial term since this might be a grey area -> qualify various means of being adversarial ie. targetted through model or perhaps just an intention
***** include semantic transferance equation in paper to introduce some formalisms -> show mathematical properties of isometric functions/spaces and how this should hold for semantic vector spaces
***** describe processes that worked and did not work -> talk about all the hurdles and show some bad examples when they occurred -> summarized below in logs
***** list hypotheses and how some were refuted by results

      CLOSED: [2020-06-17 Wed 16:48]
***** DONE maybe consider using German BERT for doing this task explicitly for German, for our end task -> German BERT and RoBERTa for English to focus on exact task -> perhaps just use xtreme repo and keep only paws-x task -> clean up code and workflow for it -> error might be arising due to gradient clipping for very large model
      CLOSED: [2020-06-17 Wed 16:48]

*** Brainstorming and logs
**** LASER embeddings + dense layers
***** not very useful by itself, needs a larger token-touching model
***** models do not show generalization, ie. training loss decreases but development loss rises
***** need to access larger token-based models to leverage full power of NLP model

**** Semantic similarity metrics
***** multireference BLEU score, use multiple paraphrases and check for best BLEU score
***** perhaps modified BLEU, METEOR, CCG semantics lambda calculus
***** perhaps some combination of edit distance with wordnet metrics
***** or NN technique using sentence BERT and other encoders -> more quantitative and continuous, can apply Michel et al. 2019 techniques for robustness comparisons
***** semantic parsing to graph, role labelling, wordnet concepts connecting, framenet, frame semantic parsing, brown clusters, AMR parsing, IWCS workshop for discussions 

**** Paraphrase generation
***** Ideas for self-paraphrasing
****** consider logical model for paraphrases, active to passive syntaxes and other logical frameworks -> use dependency parse on manual examples and check for logical process to create meaningful permutations
****** permute-paraphrase using syntax-tree chunks and test paraphrses using a detect or LASER embeddings for agnosticism between source/target

***** Viable pre-developed dynamic paraphrase-generation frameworks
****** SOW-REAP [torch, python3, average-documented] -> generate paraphrases without exemplar sentence form, worth trying out -> still poor results and only SOW model appears to be robust
******* refactor/extract out SOW model, shorten pipeline in sow to reduce computation and make input simpler
******* make quick samples from SOW and hand-select good ones, test them manually on fairseq NMT system for en-de to probe robustness
******* fork sow repo and clean code, remove bugs and make better documented with dep tracking and clearer instructions
******* require nltk word tokenize before main processing

****** SGCP [torch, python3, well-documented] -> generate paraphrases given exemplar sentence form, limitation is that exemplar sentence is a hard dependency, poor performance and not very semantically sound paraphrases
******* ParaNMT is likely to be better than QQPos since latter was trained only on qns
******* BERT score, BERT, RoBERTa for detecting paraphrases and quality
******* hand-written exemplar for meaningful output
******* remove exemplar sentence and replace with syntax form
******* clustering is done by meaning and not syntax -> or try difference via standard parse -> or random
******* provision of syntax directly instead of exemplar sentence
******* fix bug in sgcp to write all outs on separate lines and to not compute any similarity
******* change k means to find best number of clusters
******* add various paraphrase generation styles for SGCP such as same cluster, other cluster and same as source
******* require nltk word tokenize before main processing
******* future-idea: end-to-end paraphrase generation with adversarial goal, but unrealistic given time-frame and support

***** Legacy frameworks
****** Pair-it [tensorflow, python3, poorly documented] -> has potential to work but requires major refactoring
****** SCPN [torch, python2.7, poorly documented] -> buggy, but some examples work

**** Data augmentation
***** look into nli adversarial datasets -> Nevin and Aatlantise
***** either look for paraphrase source and target pair which are closest to gold ones and augment data with these -> is safer to train with and can possibly improve overall translation quality
***** otherwise, find paraphrase which is close on source side but problematic on target side and augment these with gold target -> acts as a regularizing anchor and possibly adds some stability
***** Zipf's law should apply to syntax chunks, bias might still be present
***** anchor might still be useful, look for similar syntax on the target side that can be substituted -> maybe some kind of imitation to make augmented pairs 
***** consider contributing paraphrases to data augmentation libraries from research
***** noise is not problematic since there is already noise present in normal training data
***** meaning preserving + adversarial outcome -> then useful
***** augmentation is important if adversarial attack is successful, maybe syntax real-life frequency has effect
