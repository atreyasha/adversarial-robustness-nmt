*** To-do's

**** Paraphrasing
***** Automated frameworks
****** 1. SCPN [torch] -> written in python2.7 and buggy, but some examples work
****** 2. Pair-it [tensorflow] -> written in python3, has potential to work but requires refactoring
****** TODO 3. SGCP [torch] -> written in python3, generate paraphrases given exemplar sentence form
****** test how SGCP works, memory consumption on single GPU, check if it can be tweaked for own purposes
****** generate paraphrases for WMT 17 data using previous steps
****** check if it is possible to make complete combined framework for adversarial generation

***** Rules-based approaches
****** consider other ways of generating paraphrases -> perhaps rules based approaches employing logical rules
****** look into semantic web senses and how these could be used given world knowledge
****** generate paraphrases for WMT 17 data using previous steps

**** Code and documentation
***** TODO convert all processes to makefile for ease
***** TODO add pipeline to download WMT 17 training data
***** add documentation/acknowledgments to datasets and code, refactor major code used in SCPN to make it cleaner and better
***** add citations in readme as per general standard

**** Syntax-parsers
***** download stanford parser into repo and use this on WMT 17 data
***** generate parses for WMT17 dev/test, check quality and think of how to extend this utility to other SOTA parsers

**** SOTA NMT models
***** TODO download SOTA models from fairseq, start testing paraphrased samples on it and manually check out differences in results, see if this idea makes sense on a large scale
***** look for models that worked on WMT 17 en-de dataset and work from there
***** after manual checks, start thinking of semantic similarity measures on the target end, also possibly on the source side although we can assume that the SCPN makes quite good paraphrases
***** set up English and German SOTA parsers on local system

*** Completed
***** DONE set up WMT 17 dev/test data and basic repo
