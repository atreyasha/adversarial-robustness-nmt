## Robustness of NMT models to syntax-level paraphrases

### Overview

This project will investigate whether SOTA NMT models are robust to semantics-preserving syntax-level paraphrases. Specifically, we will investigate whether NMT models are able to preserve gold semantics on the target side.

We are still under development :snail:

Check our development [log](./docs/develop.md) for further information.
